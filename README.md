# WebDevBoilerplate

A simple node server that allows you to write code you want to test in an pre-configured environment.

# Usage

Simply `npm start` or `F5` in your code editor (I use VSCode, it may differ elsewhere!) when scoped in `main.js` to launch the site. You can then just `F5` your new localhost site with changes made without restarting the server.

Unless of course you're writing Nodejs code, which requires a relaunch of the browser.

# Contributing

This is supposed to be a simple application to allow for *other* work to be done quickly. This is not supposed to be a tutorial or guide, just a template application so you can get stuff done.

With that in mind, if you have changes that make life easier for people, submit a PR! Thanks for helping out :-)
